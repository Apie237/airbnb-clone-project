## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Used for building the backend APIs, handling authentication, managing business logic, and providing a robust foundation for the server-side application.

### PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and robust feature set. Serves as the primary database for storing user data, property information, bookings, reviews, and handles complex queries with excellent performance.

### GraphQL
A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request specific data. Provides flexible and efficient data fetching, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data, and enables better API versioning and documentation.

### React.js
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Enables the creation of interactive and dynamic frontend components with efficient state management and reusable component architecture.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between parties. Used for secure authentication and authorization, maintaining user sessions across the application while ensuring stateless authentication.

### Docker
A containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into portable containers. Ensures consistent deployment across different environments, simplifies the deployment process, and provides scalability and isolation.

## Database Design

### Users
- `user_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user
- `email`: User's email address for login and communication
- `password_hash`: Securely hashed password for authentication
- `first_name`: User's first name for personalization
- `last_name`: User's last name for identification

### Properties
- `property_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each property
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key): References Users table to identify property owner
- `title`: Property listing title for display
- `description`: Detailed property description and features
- `price_per_night`: Rental cost per night in local currency

### Bookings
- `booking_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each booking
- `property_id` (Foreign Key): References Properties table
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): References Users table for guest information
- `check_in_date`: Start date of reservation
- `check_out_date`: End date of reservation

### Reviews
- `review_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each review
- `property_id` (Foreign Key): References Properties table
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): References Users table for reviewer
- `rating`: Numerical rating from 1 to 5 stars
- `comment`: Written review content and feedback

### Payments
- `payment_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key): References Bookings table
- `amount`: Payment amount in local currency
- `payment_method`: Type of payment used (credit card, PayPal, etc.)
- `payment_status`: Current status (completed, pending, failed)

### Entity Relationships
A User can own multiple Properties (one-to-many relationship). A User can make multiple Bookings (one-to-many relationship). A Property can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many relationship). A Property can have multiple Reviews (one-to-many relationship). A Booking has one associated Payment (one-to-one relationship). A User can write multiple Reviews (one-to-many relationship).

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
A comprehensive authentication system that handles user registration, login, profile management, and account settings. This feature ensures secure access control and enables users to maintain their personal information, preferences, and booking history within the platform.

### Property Management
An intuitive system for property owners to list, edit, and manage their accommodations. This includes uploading photos, setting pricing, managing availability calendars, and updating property details to attract potential guests and maximize bookings.

### Booking System
A robust reservation system that allows users to search for properties, check availability, make bookings, and manage their reservations. The system handles date validation, pricing calculations, and booking confirmations with automated email notifications.

### Review and Rating System
A feedback mechanism that enables guests to rate and review properties after their stay, while allowing property owners to respond to reviews. This feature builds trust within the community and helps users make informed booking decisions.

### Payment Processing
A secure payment system that handles transaction processing, payment method management, and financial record keeping. The system integrates with external payment processors to ensure secure and reliable payment processing with fraud protection.

### Search and Filtering
Advanced search functionality that allows users to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and other criteria. This feature includes map integration and sophisticated filtering options to help users find their ideal accommodation quickly.

## API Security

### Authentication
Implementation of JWT-based authentication ensures that only verified users can access protected resources. This includes secure login mechanisms, password hashing using industry-standard algorithms, and session management to maintain user security throughout their interaction with the platform.

### Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role. Property owners can only modify their own listings, while guests can only access their own booking information, maintaining data privacy and system integrity.

### Rate Limiting
Protection against API abuse through request rate limiting prevents malicious attacks and ensures fair resource usage among all users. This includes implementing throttling mechanisms for both authenticated and anonymous users to maintain system performance and availability.

Security is crucial for protecting user privacy, financial information, and maintaining platform trust. In the context of property rentals, users share personal information and payment details, making robust security measures essential for preventing data breaches, financial fraud, and unauthorized access to user accounts and property information.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software development practice that automates the process of code integration, testing, and deployment. CI ensures that code changes are regularly merged and tested, while CD automates the deployment process to various environments.

### Benefits of CI/CD Pipelines
CI/CD pipelines provide faster deployment by automating manual processes, enabling automated testing to catch bugs early, and ensuring consistent deployments across environments. They reduce human error, improve code quality through automated checks, and enable rapid iteration and feature delivery to users.

### Tools and Implementation
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for testing, building, and deploying code changes
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments
- **Testing Frameworks**: Automated unit and integration testing
- **Code Quality Tools**: Linting and code analysis for maintaining standards

The CI/CD pipeline will automatically run tests, perform security scans, build Docker images, and deploy to staging environments for every pull request, with production deployments triggered by merges to the main branch.
