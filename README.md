## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Used for building the backend APIs, handling authentication, and managing business logic.

### PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and robust feature set. Serves as the primary database for storing user data, property information, bookings, and reviews.

### GraphQL
A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request specific data. Provides flexible and efficient data fetching, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

### React.js
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Enables the creation of interactive and dynamic frontend components with efficient state management.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between parties. Used for secure authentication and authorization, maintaining user sessions across the application.

### Docker
A containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into portable containers. Ensures consistent deployment across different environments and simplifies the deployment process.

**Purpose**: Store property listing information and details
- `property_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each property
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key): References Users table
- `title`: Property listing title
- `description`: Detailed property description
- `price_per_night`: Rental cost per night
- `location`: Property address and coordinates
- `amenities`: Available facilities and services

### Bookings
**Purpose**: Track reservation information and booking status
- `booking_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each booking
- `property_id` (Foreign Key): References Properties table
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): References Users table
- `check_in_date`: Start date of reservation
- `check_out_date`: End date of reservation
- `total_amount`: Total cost of booking
- `booking_status`: Current status (confirmed, pending, cancelled)

### Reviews
**Purpose**: Store user feedback and ratings for properties
- `review_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each review
- `property_id` (Foreign Key): References Properties table
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): References Users table
- `rating`: Numerical rating (1-5 stars)
- `comment`: Written review content
- `created_at`: Review submission timestamp

### Payments
**Purpose**: Track financial transactions and payment details
- `payment_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key): References Bookings table
- `amount`: Payment amount
- `payment_method`: Type of payment (credit card, PayPal, etc.)
- `payment_status`: Current status (completed, pending, failed)
- `transaction_id`: External payment processor reference

### Entity Relationships
- A User can own multiple Properties (one-to-many)
- A User can make multiple Bookings (one-to-many)
- A Property can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many)
- A Property can have multiple Reviews (one-to-many)
- A Booking has one associated Payment (one-to-one)
- A User can write multiple Reviews (one-to-many)

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
A comprehensive authentication system that handles user registration, login, profile management, and account settings. This feature ensures secure access control and enables users to maintain their personal information, preferences, and booking history within the platform.

### Property Management
An intuitive system for property owners to list, edit, and manage their accommodations. This includes uploading photos, setting pricing, managing availability calendars, and updating property details to attract potential guests.

### Booking System
A robust reservation system that allows users to search for properties, check availability, make bookings, and manage their reservations. The system handles date validation, pricing calculations, and booking confirmations with email notifications.

### Review and Rating System
A feedback mechanism that enables guests to rate and review properties after their stay, while allowing property owners to respond to reviews. This feature builds trust within the community and helps users make informed booking decisions.

### Payment Processing
A secure payment system that handles transaction processing, payment method management, and financial record keeping. The system integrates with external payment processors to ensure secure and reliable payment processing.

### Search and Filtering
Advanced search functionality that allows users to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and other criteria. This feature includes map integration and sophisticated filtering options to help users find their ideal accommodation.

## API Security

### Authentication
Implementation of JWT-based authentication ensures that only verified users can access protected resources. This includes secure login mechanisms, password hashing using industry-standard algorithms, and session management to maintain user security throughout their interaction with the platform.

### Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role. Property owners can only modify their own listings, while guests can only access their own booking information, maintaining data privacy and system integrity.

### Rate Limiting
Protection against API abuse through request rate limiting prevents malicious attacks and ensures fair resource usage among all users. This includes implementing throttling mechanisms for both authenticated and anonymous users to maintain system performance and availability.

### Data Validation
Comprehensive input validation and sanitization protect against injection attacks and ensure data integrity. All user inputs are validated both on the client and server side, with proper error handling to prevent system vulnerabilities while maintaining a good user experience.

### HTTPS and Encryption
All data transmission is secured using HTTPS encryption, protecting sensitive information such as payment details and personal data during transfer. Additionally, sensitive data at rest is encrypted using appropriate encryption standards.

Security is crucial for protecting user privacy, financial information, and maintaining platform trust. In the context of property rentals, users share personal information and payment details, making robust security measures essential for preventing data breaches, financial fraud, and unauthorized access to user accounts and property information.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software development practice that automates the process of code integration, testing, and deployment. CI ensures that code changes are regularly merged and tested, while CD automates the deployment process to various environments.

### Importance for the Project
CI/CD pipelines are crucial for maintaining code quality, reducing deployment risks, and enabling rapid iteration. They ensure that every code change is automatically tested, validated, and deployed consistently across different environments, reducing human error and improving development efficiency.

### Tools and Implementation
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for testing, building, and deploying code changes
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments
- **Testing Frameworks**: Automated unit and integration testing
- **Code Quality Tools**: Linting and code analysis for maintaining standards
- **Environment Management**: Separate staging and production deployment pipelines

The CI/CD pipeline will automatically run tests, perform security scans, build Docker images, and deploy to staging environments for every pull request, with production deployments triggered by merges to the main branch. This ensures reliable, consistent, and rapid delivery of new features and bug fixes.
